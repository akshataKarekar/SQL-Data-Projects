MSQL

I have used the MySQL command line interface (CLI) to create a database, restore the structure and contents of tables, explore and query tables, and finally, learn how to dump/backup tables from the database.

The Sakila database used in this lab comes from the following source: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/ under New BSD license [Copyright 2021 - Oracle Corporation].

PostgreSQL

In this imaginary scenario, I have recently been hired as a data engineer by a New York-based coffee shop chain looking to expand nationally by opening several franchise locations. They want to streamline operations and revamp their data infrastructure as part of their expansion process.

My job is to design their relational database systems for improved operational efficiencies and to make it easier for their executives to make data-driven decisions.

Currently, their data resides in several different systems: accounting software, suppliers' databases, point of sales (POS) systems, and even spreadsheets. I will review the data in these systems and design a central database to house all of their data. I will then create the database objects and load them with source data. Finally, I will create subsets of data your business partners require, export them, and load them into staging databases using different RDBMS.

The Data used in this project is attached in the respective folder within PostgreSQL as CoffeeData.sql
